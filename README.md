# Said Azaizah — Life in Motion

A narrative of ideas, artifacts, and action. A world-facing story built from work, trust, and continuous learning.

***

## Welcome
I aim to show who I am by living the story, not listing it in bullets. This is a cinematic, evidence-powered narrative of building things that matter and bridging communities that matter more.

I’m a student-builder from a mixed Arab/Jewish environment in Israel, and my work centers on two forces that shape me:
- Craft — turning ideas into usable systems
- Bridge-building — creating trust where it’s easy to give up

This site is a proof-driven narrative: cinematic in tone, founder’s voice, grounded in real artifacts—photos, demos, writeups, links.

***

## How the site is organized
Everything here unfolds as chapters, not cards. Each chapter has three layers:
- Hook — a one-line idea plus a headline
- Beats — short cinematic lines you scroll through
- Case File — context, what I did, impact, and evidence (links)

This structure lets readers skim quickly or dive deep without losing the story.

## Where to start

### Story
The main experience after the introduction: a curated timeline of scenes that connect years, decisions, and turning points.

### Honors
A proof-first view of recognition and milestones—designed to be readable fast and verifiable.

### Ventures
The real-world projects where founder thinking shows up most clearly.

### Life Atlas
A map of experiences—community, teaching, movement, leadership—the “why” behind the work.

### Books
A small shelf of ideas that shaped how I think.

## What you’ll find inside (high level)

### Ventures — building real things
- RoofMate — a student housing and roommate-matching product shaped by listening, iteration, and trust design
- Peptide Visual Lab — a research-and-engineering effort building a framework for understanding biological sequences through visualization and computation
- EmpowerED — a community-driven initiative focused on empowerment through learning and leadership

### Experiences — the environments that built me
- MEET (Middle East Entrepreneurs of Tomorrow) — learning to work across difference and still ship
- MEET TA — teaching and mentorship as a craft, not a checkbox
- Leyada tutoring / volunteering — long-term commitment, including 180+ hours of CS/math tutoring
- Dabka — movement as identity and discipline

### Honors — evidence-first
This section is intentionally designed to be supported by links, media, and proof pages—because credibility matters more than hype.

## Design philosophy (for world readers)

- Evidence-first: strong claims deserve links, demos, photos, or artifacts.
- Founder clarity: identify the problem, the solution, the impact, and the lessons.
- Human tone: this is a living record of growth, not a corporate brochure.

***

## Media and privacy notes
Some videos are intentionally unlisted; some artifacts are shared as proof links rather than public embeds. This keeps the site focused, respectful, and clean while preserving transparency.

### Future visions (what comes next)
- Scale and iterate RoofMate to serve diverse campus communities globally, with a strong emphasis on inclusive design and data privacy.
- Expand Peptide Visual Lab into an open visualization platform for biology education and research collaboration.
- Grow EmpowerED into a global network that centers student leadership, mentorship, and peer-to-peer learning across disciplines.
- Build a global Life Atlas that maps impact, collaboration networks, and learning paths to connect ideas with action.
